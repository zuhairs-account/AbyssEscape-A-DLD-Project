May 2025 update: Since this repository was created, I've seen scores of maze style projects build off of this one, some of which went on to win prizes. It's a weird feeling to have indirectly had a hand in those. So, to the viewer who searched GitHub projects to look for DLD projects to take inspiration from, I'm curious to see what you're building. Do let me know if you wish.

Anyway, this is a horror game.

Entry to the Digital Logic and Design Project Exhibition and Competition. My project, Abyss Escape, was a horror game in which you guide a character using a joystick hooked up to an FPGA to get the key and exit under 100 seconds while avoiding a monster.

This project won 3rd place.
